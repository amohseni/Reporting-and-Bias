There is a true distribution of events which occur and are then selected and/or distorted by the news. Individuals begin with prior beliefs and a tendency to accept news congenial those beliefs and reject news uncongenial to those beliefs. Upon hearing the news, individuals select which new items to trust, given their biases, and update their beliefs accordingly."

Each form of distortion has its own characteristics effects."
